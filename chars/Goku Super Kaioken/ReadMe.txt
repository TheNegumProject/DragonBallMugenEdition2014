Overview:
--------------
(As derived from the official site...)

Goku is the hero of Dragon Ball Z, the most powerful warrior on earth and the first to 
become Super Saiyan in over 1000 years. When the Saiyans arrive, Goku learns the mysterious 
secret of his own past: he is a Saiyan formerly named Kakarot. Goku was sent to Earth as a 
baby to grow up and destroy the planet, but a head injury as a child scrambled Goku?s 
programming. Instead of growing up to become a destructive super-warrior, he became innocent 
and pure of heart, fighting for good.
