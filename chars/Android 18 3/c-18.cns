; Variable usage:
; This is a record of the variables that KFM uses. Keeping a record of your
; variable usage helps you avoid careless mistakes later.
; var(1)  - Used in kfm.cmd for combo condition (updated every tick)
; var(2)  - Used in Kung Fu Throw (state 800) to remember if fwd was being
;           held (remembered from state 800 through state 810).
